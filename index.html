            <p>By bringing people and animals together, zoos educate the public and foster an appreciation of the other species.
               Zoos save endangered species by bringing them into a safe environment, where they are protected from poachers, habitat loss, starvation, and predators.
Many zoos have breeding programs for endangered species. In the wild, these individuals might have trouble finding mates and breeding, and species could become extinct.
Reputable zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and are held to high standards for the treatment of their resident animals. According to the AZA, accreditation means, "official recognition and approval of a zoo or aquarium by a group of experts."
A good zoo provides an enriched habitat in which the animals are never bored, are well cared for, and have plenty of space.

            <p>Nowodays, a lot of animals live in zoos. Is it right or wrong to keep them in the zoos? The following essay presents some pros and cons of this problem.
               First of all, people can see wild, beautiful, exotic animals. They can see how animals live and behave. Secondly, animals have good life conditions in zoos. they do not starve because they have food and water. People take care of animals. Moreover, animals are safe. People do not kill them. Animals live as close to the natural habitat as possible. For instance, water and other natural barrieres are used to separate animals from each other and from the visitors.
               On the other hand, keeping animals in zoos is harmful for them. The animals are forced to live in a unnatural habitat. There is not enough living space in the zoos, when often makes animals unhappy and restless. It is also true that, some animals do not proliferate in zoos. Secondly, animlas should live in freedom, because it is their natural haitat. Moreover, animals in the zoos live under stress. The worst thing is that animals in the zoos will never be able to exsist in their natural habitat alone. They have will not any chance to survive.
               In conclusion, it seems that keeping wild animals in zoos is more benefical than harmful. I think that it is profitable for all animals, because they have good protection. They can feel safe.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of maintaining zoos for people who visit</h2>

            <p>Zoos provide people with the opportunity to peer into the wild without actually traveling to distant locations around the world, searching for rare or exotic animals. Zoos contain a range of animals, depending on the size;
               some contain large animals, such as giraffes, elephants and lions, and even large and venomous snakes.
               One of the central advantages - at least in terms of human advantages - lies in the education that people receive when visiting a zoo. They receive firsthand knowledge of how animals behave and act. Most zoos also provide
                interactive shows with some of the animals during secific times throughout the week. Surrounding the exhibits, zoos usually have information describing the animal, its history and natural location. Learning about animals
               also brings empathy to many people, raising awareness about their endangerment in the wild, which can often be attributed to human causes.</p>
